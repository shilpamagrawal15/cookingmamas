var homeText = "Welcome to your new job at Klopfers Krazy Katering business! You have come at just the right time - the business is quickly growing and we need great chefs like you to help us meet our client demands and keep our 5-star rating. Here are some things to get you started. \n Choose a level and take note of the corresponding client objective. Check out the supplies available in your kitchen cabinet. Look through the original recipes and note how many servings they each provide. In Levels 1-3, there are two types of entrees and two types of desserts that you can pick and choose from. Fill out the new recipes to make the right amount of entrees and desserts using the food available in the cabinet. Notice that the amount of food in the cabinet updates itself as you fill out your new recipes. Press the Cook! button to send your helper chefs into action to execute the recipes with the amounts of ingredients that you provided and check out the feedback from Head Chef Klopfer afterwards!";
